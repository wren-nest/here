                    <p>Target. Spent 20 minutes walking in circles. Didn’t want to ask where they keep gloves. I found them eventually. Walked past them three times before I did. Walked past a high school friend. I don’t know if they recognised me.</p>

                    <p>Dollar store. Terrible quality notebook. It was only four dollars. Easier to write in something that doesn’t feel fancy. Nothing actually costs a dollar anymore. On Monday I’ll say this to him, and he’ll tell me that he was at the mall today too. </p>

                    <p>I knew I would run into him. Or, I was hoping that I would. We had lunch together. Burritos. They kind of sucked. Tasted a little better with him sitting next to me. </p>

                    <p>We spent all afternoon just wandering around. I don’t remember what we were looking for, I don’t think we found it. I kept looking at him instead of the shops. I want to see more of his smile. </p>
