                    <p>It wasn’t a perfect day. But it’s my favourite. The sky was overcast. We didn’t arrive until late in the day. Not quite on time for sunshine. A little too early for sunset. It was starting to get cold. That meant people were leaving. We didn’t quite have the coastline to ourselves, but it was quiet enough to feel like it.</p>
                    <p>We walked along the rockpools. Halfway up the cliff-face. He hops between the rocks with such confidence. I struggled to keep up. Every time I pause at a gap, one a little wider than I know how to navigate, I look up. His smile is right there. Waiting for me. He’s terribly pretty. Who cares about the sunset? He doesn’t even compare. </p>
                    <p>He points out the easiest spots to place my feet. Gentle. Reassuring. Here are the most stable rocks. The least slippery piles of sand. The sturdiest of tree branches. My heart raced every time I jumped. But I knew it would be alright. Even if I fell, he would be there to help me back to my feet. </p>
                    <p>It wasn’t any faster to navigate our way back. I’m not one to drop my caution so easily. I kept glancing at his hands. There never seemed to be a good opportunity to reach out for him. I’d probably only slow him down. He kept pausing, waiting for me to catch up. Watching. Never impatient. Never too far off. Just far enough ahead to lead the way. </p>
                    <p>It was quite cold by the time we made our way back to our spot. He covered our legs with a towel. He took out a book. I watched the horizon. The wind nipped at our shoulders. I leaned a little closer to him. </p>

                    <p>It was pouring rain. Even if they hadn’t closed the beach, I wouldn’t have let him near the ocean that day. It looked hungry. The waves were deafening. We had to speak loudly just to hear each other. Huddled close in our raincoats. Swiping raindrops off our phone screens. I had never noticed the café there before. That day it shone like a lighthouse through the fog.</p>
                    <p>The rain hammered on the roof. The windows rattled with every roll of thunder. There was the distinct noise of water dripping into a bucket coming from the kitchen. The lady at the counter had eyes that crinkled at the edges when she smiled. She recommended the scones. They were almost as warm and sweet as him. While we waited for our coffees, I held his hands. Just to warm them up.</p>

                    <p>He has a shelf above his desk. It’s a bit too high up for him to actually look at while he’s sitting down. It’s cluttered, but never dusty.</p>
                    <p>A dozen old books with beautiful covers.</p>
                    <p>A stack of postcards thicker than my arm, tied up with string. One time he laid them out over his bed and told me where each one was from. More trinkets than I can count.</p>
                    <p>A battered tin full of coins from seven different countries. A few of them he hasn’t even been to before.</p>
                    <p>A dried bunch of flowers with a green ribbon, from his high school graduation. </p>
                    <p>Tiny statues of animals. A glass fox with a frosted tail. A ceramic horse with a melancholy expression. Three plastic dinosaurs. A tree with a tiny bird perched on a branch (broken and glued back together in two places). </p>

                    <p>He’s started to blue-tack things along the edge, for lack of space actually on the shelf. He put up two of his favourite postcards. The birthday card I gave him. A polaroid of us, from my birthday party. Ticket stubs from the cinema. A parking ticket, I don’t know where that one is from. I think it reminds him of me, as well. I’ll find out, one day. </p>

                    <p>Washing machine broke. I’m surprised it lasted as long as it did. Taking your dirty laundry out in public is embarrassing. I wasn’t paying attention to anything. Just put everything in as quickly as possible. I was trying not to pay attention to anything. I glanced down. His jumper was in my hand. I paused. I smiled.</p>
                    <p>I didn’t hurry as much. </p>

                    <p>He poked his head into my cubicle. I nearly jumped out of my chair. People don’t tend to pay attention to me. I’m pretty sure I forgot to say ‘nice to meet you, too’. </p>
                    <p>He was doing something small and unimportant. Helping the intern collect coffee orders. Inviting everyone to a slice of cake someone brought in. Handing out flyers for something his neighbour was doing. I don’t remember exactly.</p>
                    <p>His smile was so handsome, I don’t think I was paying attention to a single thing he said. I don’t usually have trouble with that sort of thing. And, as he spoke to me, his smile only grew wider. Softer at the edges. More genuine.</p>
                    <p>He was about to leave.</p>
                    <p>“I hope I’ll see you around.” I said.</p>
                    <p>I don’t usually say that kind of thing.</p>
                    <p>His smile shone like the sun.</p>
                    <p>“I’m sure you will.” </p>
